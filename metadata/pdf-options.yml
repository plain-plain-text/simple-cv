filename: H-W-Jones # no '.pdf' needed.
footer: # comment out this entire section to disable the footer
  last-modified: true
  display-author: true
regular-font: Times New Roman # please see Fonts-README.md for more information
headings: overlapped # section headings jut out to the left a bit. The other option, “margin,” moves the headings to the left on their own.
pdf-smallcaps-headings: true # To make headings use the smallcaps font.
pdf-bold-as-smallcaps: true # To make Markdown text typed **like this** become small caps.

left-margin: .5in
# right-margin: .5in # Only needed for unequal margins
top-margin: .5in # Minimum of about .25in or 2cm
# bottom-margin: 2in # Only for unequal margins. Useful if footer is too low.
display-style: line # The style for the top of the page. This can be any memoir chapter style as demonstrated in 10.5 of the Memoir manual: http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex/memoir/memman.pdf. Reasonable values include: bianchi, bringhurst, chappell, crosshead, demo2, dowding, lyhne, and wilsondob. Some of these styles will clobber your font choices. “line” is a style I created based on the res.cls line option.
